							<h3>Restler Boot</h3>
						</header>
						<p>A Micro-framework for building REST+JSON API with emphasis on Domain Driven Design methodology and NoSQL persistence. Its a set of libraries and application structure to help you build RESTful API in the fastest way by pre-configuring defaults. It is built on top of the popular <a href="http://luracast.com/products/restler/">Restler</a> by <a href="http://www.luracast.com/">Luracast</a></p>

						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>The easiest way to build a RESTful JSON API using PHP.</p>
					</header>
					<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Develop reusable Microservices.</li>
						<li>Built with Domain Driven Design style</li>
						<li>HATEOAS compliant</li>
						<li>NoSQL enabled for BigData capability</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Unlike traditional web frameworks which attempts to do everything, Restler Boot is a highly opinionated and is meant for a very specific use-case. Not only it targets purely RESTful JSON API, but it also attempts to structure your application with HATEOAS in mind.</p>

					<p>The primary objects in Restler Boot are not the Models, View neither Controllers. Instead we had shifted it into <b>Resource</b> and <b>Collections</b></p>

					<p>A Resource is the object we want to expose in the API, this is usually represented by a single entity or table in the database. For example user, account, transaction and bank are all Resources.</p>

					<p>A group of Resources is called Collection, this is usually represented as an array of JSON objects.</p>
					<p>Whenever we need to perform any operation in resources (create,read,update,delete) it has to be in the form of HTTP verbs: PUT, GET, POST, DELETE. All other methods of manipulating data is strongly discouraged.</p>

					<table class="table">
						<tr>
							<th>Operation</th>
							<th>HTTP Verb</th>
							<th>Sample URL</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Create</td>
							<td>PUT</td>
							<td>http://api.example.com/banks</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Read</td>
							<td>GET</td>
							<td>http://api.example.com/banks/123</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Update</td>
							<td>POST</td>
							<td>http://api.example.com/banks</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Delete</td>
							<td>DELETE</td>
							<td>http://api.example.com/banks/123</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
